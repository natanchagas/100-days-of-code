# 100-days-of-code

The idea of the project is to commit yourself at least one hour a day to code in any language you want for a hundred days (at least). The regularity is key here, you need to practice a bit everyday, including the weekends.
All the challenges present here are medium/hard level. You can (and you should) participate even if you don't have much experience with coding, it will only take a bit longer.
Most of the challenges can be solved in three hours or less.
